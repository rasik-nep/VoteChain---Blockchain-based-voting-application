# Blockchain-Based Voting Application

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a decentralized voting application built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. The application is designed to run on a local Ethereum-based chain, specifically Ganache, for ease of development and testing.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization**: The voting process is decentralized, eliminating the need for a central authority and ensuring transparency.

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity smart contracts govern the core logic of the voting application, providing a secure and automated process.

- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for voters to cast their votes securely and easily.

- **Security and Transparency**: Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring security and transparency.

- **Ganache Integration**: Developed and tested on Ganache, a local Ethereum-based chain, for rapid prototyping and testing.
